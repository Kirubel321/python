#### Brute-force approach

In this approach, we will follow the Brute-force approach. It is an exhaustive search algorithm where all the possible test solutions are checked for getting the optimal solution.
Algorithm
Follow the algorithm to understand the approach better

Step 1- Define a function to find the second largest number in the list

Step 2- Declare variables and store the maximum nd minimum between the first and the second element in the list

Step 3- Find length of list using len() and store in n

Step 4- Run a loop from 2 to n

Step 5- Check if list element is greater than maximum, if true update second maximum to maximum and set list element as maximum

Step 6- Else, if list element is greater than second maximum number then update list element as second maximum

Step 7- Return second maximum element

Step 8- Declare a list and take input or initialise values

Step 9- Call the function

Step 10- Print the value returned by the function
