## What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

## It is used for:
 ```
web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.
 ```   
## What can Python do?

* Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
* Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
* Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
* Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
* Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
 
## Why Python?

* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
* Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
* Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

#### Brute-force approach

In this approach, we will follow the Brute-force approach. It is an exhaustive search algorithm where all the possible test solutions are checked for getting the optimal solution.
Algorithm
Follow the algorithm to understand the approach better
```
Step 1- Define a function to find the second largest number in the list

Step 2- Declare variables and store the maximum nd minimum between the first and the second element in the list

Step 3- Find length of list using len() and store in n

Step 4- Run a loop from 2 to n

Step 5- Check if list element is greater than maximum, if true update second maximum to maximum and set list element as maximum

Step 6- Else, if list element is greater than second maximum number then update list element as second maximum

Step 7- Return second maximum element

Step 8- Declare a list and take input or initialise values

Step 9- Call the function

Step 10- Print the value returned by the function

## Python Collections (Arrays)

### There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

* List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
* Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
* Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
* Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
